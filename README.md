# Snake Game
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/sBdNGJmn1Ew
#### Description:
This is my final project for the CS50P class.
I made a simple snake game using the pygame library. The game has a starting menu, a ending menu and the game itself. To play the game you need to run project.py and press the "Play" button, afterwards you can control the snake with the wasd keys. At any point you can press the x and quit the game or press the "Quit" button at the strating menu or the ending menu.
